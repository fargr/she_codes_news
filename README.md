## About This Project
{{ I broke it entirely today (the day of submission, so I have no images and nothing is functional? As the site is non-functional currently I have no images for any of the work I did either. )}}
## How To Run This Code
{{
Give a quick step-by-step guide on how to download and run your codebase.
It's ok to assume the reader is another developer here, so don't feel like you
have to explain what a virtual environment is, etc.
Give directions like "clone the repo to your local machine", "create a virtual
environment", "migrate the database", etc.
When you need to specify terminal commands, you can surround them with
backticks, like so: `python manage.py runserver`. This formats them as
code in the markdown document. (The backtick key is to the left of the
number 1 at the top of your keyboard.)
